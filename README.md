# steam-inventory
Tool for managing steam inventory prices

## Progress

What need to be done to make this tool `stable and usable`?:

 - [ ] Find search engine good for scraping (Google throws Captcha)
    - [ ] Need to have domain filter (csgostash.com)
    - [ ] Easy to scrape (static item classes)
 - [ ] Make scraper for csgostatsh.com (should be easy)
    - [ ] Standard requests scraping with BeautifulSoup
